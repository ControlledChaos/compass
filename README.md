## Things for the future

### Genericons

If Genericons gets Bower support, then pull it as a dependency via Bower, and update the rename task accordingly. There is likely to be a replace for the path to font files too.

### `.screen-reader-text`

Switch to using clip method.

## Sort out how RTL CSS file

Hybrid potentially tries to load css/rtl.css? Check if it does, and adjust cssjanus task accordingly.
